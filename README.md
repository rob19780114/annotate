Annotate
========

Just a try on how to extract an self-defined annotation from
a class and do something with it. Where

"Todo" defines an interface used as annotation
"App" simple is a stand-alone java program that prints out "value" used to annotate itself

I developed this using

$ java -version
java version "1.6.0_33"
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.6.0_33-b03)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 20.8-b03, mixed mode) using Gentoo/Linux

$ mvn -version
Apache Maven 2.2.1 (r801777; 2009-08-06 20:16:01+0100)
Java version: 1.6.0_33
